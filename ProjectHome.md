NIntegrate is a open source .NET SOA Integration Framework on the top of WCF. The goal of NIntegrate is to implement a rapid development framework for .NET developers to apply SOA design patterns easier.

NIntegrate provides several reusable SOA components to solve specific enterprise SOA problems. Different from some other one-in-one SOA solution, NIntegrate is designed to be easily integrated with your companyâ€™s application frameworks.

### Problems NIntegrate Solves: ###
  * Decouple WCF configuration from Web.config/App.config files.
  * Dynamic query through WCF.
  * Cross-Domain AJAX WCF Call
  * Flexible object mapping.
  * LRU dictionary caching.
  * SingleThreadQueue.
